# ssh-maker
generates bash scripts for ssh.

This program will only run on linux.  
When entering key folder path, don't put / at end of path.  
Creates a file called .sshmaker-config  
When the program is finished a file is created called ./{name} in your home dir.  
Run it by typing ./{name} (You probably already knew that), the file has already been given perms to execute.  
Thankyou for using sshmaker :)
