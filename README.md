# ssh-maker
generates bash scripts for ssh.  
**This is for lazy people or people who can't remember the ips of their servers :P**

**This program will only run on linux.**  
When entering key folder name, don't put / at end.  
Creates a file called config.json in /etc/sshmaker.  
When the program is finished a file is created called ./{name} in your home dir.  
Run it by typing ./{name} (You probably already knew that), the file has already been given perms to execute.  
You can move the sshmaker program into /usr/bin so that it runs as a command (You probably already knew that too)  
Thankyou for using sshmaker :)
