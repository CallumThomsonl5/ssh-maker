# ssh-maker
generates bash scripts for ssh.

Note
When entering key folder path, don't put / at end of path.
Don't have the program in a dir in which you need perms to write as it makes a config file called .sshmaker-config. 
After the program finishes there should be a file in the dir in which the program is located with the name that you put in when asked for the server name, to connect do ./{name}.
